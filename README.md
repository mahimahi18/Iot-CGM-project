# Project Description
This project focuses on building a robust, explainable, data-driven anomaly-detection system designed specifically for CGM data. The goal is to distinguish between actual medical emergencies and sensor-related malfunctions, using a combination of unsupervised anomaly detection and supervised classification. Additionally, we incorporate explainability tools to ensure that the model’s decisions are transparent and trustworthy, especially in an IoT healthcare setting where safety is critical.
